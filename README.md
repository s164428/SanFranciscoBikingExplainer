# Explainer Notebook for San Francisco Biking Project
The primary Website for this project can be found here: [What came first: The Bicyclist, or the Bicycle Lane?](https://s164428.github.io/SanFranciscoBiking/posts/sanfranciscobiking/)

This explainer notebook contains a walkthrough of the data analysis performed behind the scenes, as well as diagrams and plots that were used internally in the analysis.
Additionally, the datasets used by the Explainer are included as well, snapshotted in the versions that were used during the analysis.
The original links to all the datasets can be found within the Explainer Notebook.

# How to install/view
As this Notebook extensively relies on dynamic Bokeh plots which will not render on Github, you must run it locally to see the full results. To do this, use the **Code -> Download ZIP** button from the main page to download the Notebook and all data. Extract to a folder of your choosing, and open it using Jupyter Notebook.
